            <p>
              We aren't a mega shop with locations in 100 cities. We're a local
              company that only hires locally. Founding Alberto's Handyman Co.
              is a personal dream I have aspired to achieve for nearly a decade.
              To make it here, I had to study, improve, and master my craft
              before I could establish myself in Dallas. We've been in business
              for almost 3 years now.

              I am a hard-working tradesman originally from Mexico. I started my
              handyman career early, learning the basics working at my father's
              development company. He taught me everything from how to read a
              tape measure to professionally painting, installing drywall and
              doing kitchen and bathroom remodeling. I picked up skills from him
              passed down through several generations. Using that foundation, I
              have continued to develop my skills by using more modern
              techniques, familiarizing myself with new materials, and using
              more advanced tools. After a 10 year stint in the construction
              industry I decided to use all of my learned knowledge to start
              Alberto's Handyman Co.

              I'm a family man with roots in the community. I live in south
              Dallas in the OakCliff area with my wife and new-born daughter. We
              believe in having a strong community, moral values, good ethics,
              and safety. We won't jeopardize our integrity by performing
              sub-standard work for our customers. We provide personalized and
              professional services by people you can trust.
