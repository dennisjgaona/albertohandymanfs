    mainDescription: `A fresh coat of paint on a wall, when professionally applied, can make a world of difference when it comes to the look and feel of a room. 
      
      Alberto's HandyMan Co. has the knowledge and experience needed to provide you with great results at affordable prices. But no matter how good we are at painting, a wall with holes or wear and tear won't look too good even with a fresh paint job. That's why we also take the time to repair your drywall beforehand to offer the best results possible. And that includes repairing water damaged drywall.
      
      Wet drywall loses its structural integrity and becomes weak, causing holes and other issues. If you have water damage in your drywall, we'll remove the damaged areas and replace with new drywall. We professionally apply a joining compound for a seamless look and when painted, you're left with your wall looking brand new.`,

    mainDescription: `Grout and caulking are often looked past when it comes to thinking about repairs, but they serve very important purposes.

A properly sealed countertop and grouted floor can prevent water damage by creating a seal.

And sealing windows and doors can help save money on your heating and cooling bills!

Over time (or with improper installation), caulking and grout can degrade and will need to be replaced to maintain their seal.

Alberto's HandyMan Co. has years of experience ensuring your caulking and grout has a proper seal, preserving your countertops, tile floors, and more.`,

Not only is properly installed tile durable, it is easy to clean, easy to maintain and offers design flexibility that other wall and flooring options simply do not.

However, improperly installed tile can be uneven and not very durable.

That's why it's important to have professionals, like the Alberto's HandyMan Co. team, install your tile.

And we also install kitchen backsplashes to help add a unique aesthetic touch to your kitchen!

Whatever the tile or backsplash project, Alberto's HandyMan Co. can install everything professionally and in a timely manner.`,
